# Oracle .NET Code Sample Repository

## About Oracle .NET
This repository provides .NET code samples for Oracle developers, specifically for Oracle Data Provider for .NET (ODP.NET)
and other Oracle .NET components. .NET products for Oracle Database are free of charge. They consist of:

<ul>
<li>Oracle Data Provider for .NET (ODP.NET) - an optimized ADO.NET data access provider to the Oracle database. ODP.NET allows developers to take advantage of advanced Oracle database functionality, including Real Application Clusters, XML DB, and self-updating client caches. ODP.NET offers three provider types: Core for .NET (Core) runtimes, managed for .NET Framework (100% managed code and easy deployment), and unmanaged for .NET Framework.</li>
<li>Oracle Developer Tools for Visual Studio - a tightly integrated design-time "Add-in" for Microsoft Visual Studio that provides full Oracle .NET application lifecycle management, including PL/SQL debugging and schema comparison tools.</li>
  <li>Oracle Developer Tools for VS Code - enables Visual Studio Code developers to connect to Oracle Database and Oracle Autonomous Database, edit SQL and PL/SQL with autocomplete, Intellisense, breadcrumbs, and syntax coloring, execute SQL and PL/SQL and view and save the results in formats such as .CSV and JSON. The Oracle Database Explorer tree control allows you to quickly explore your database schema, view table data, and edit, execute and save PL/SQL.</li>
<li>Oracle Providers for ASP.NET - a collection of ASP.NET providers that use Oracle Database as the data source. ASP.NET applications can store various types of website state in an Oracle database, which can then be shared across the application.</li>
</ul>

## Getting Started
Oracle .NET components are available individually on NuGet Gallery or bundled together as part of Oracle Data Access Components (ODAC). Provider downloads are available from <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=oracle">NuGet Gallery<a> and <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/net-downloads.html">Oracle .NET download page</a>. Oracle Developer Tools for VS Code or Visual Studio can be downloaded from the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Oracle.oracledevtools">VS Code Marketplace</a> or <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/OracleCorporation">Visual Studio Marketplace</a>, respectively.

## Tutorials
For beginning Oracle .NET developers, these <a href="https://www.oracle.com/tools/technologies/quickstart-dotnet-for-oracle-database.html">on-premises .NET database tutorials</a> and <a href="https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/dotnet/adbdotnetquickstarts.html">Autonomous Database .NET tutorials</a> will assist you in getting started with .NET application development with Oracle Database. 
  
Oracle .NET video tutorials are available from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/OracleDOTNETTeam">Oracle .NET YouTube site.
  
For those that want to build an end-to-end basic .NET web app for Oracle Database in the cloud, try the <a href="https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/dbpm/r/livelabs/view-workshop?wid=3359">.NET Development with Oracle Autonomous Database Quick Start</a>. The tutorial takes about an hour to complete and is free. By the end, you will have a complete running .NET website and database.
